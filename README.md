# odin-admin-dashboard

### Description
An admin dashboard design using grid layout. I made this following this [lesson](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard) on theodinproject.com. The task was to recreate an admin dashboard from an image using mainly css grid layouts.
